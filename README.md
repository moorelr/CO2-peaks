# CO2-peaks
Script for processing Raman spectra to fit CO2 peaks (a.k.a. "Fermi Diad")

TODO:
- I wrote a lot of this a long time ago. There's a lot of redundancy and poor documentation. :(
- Provide documentation for sample data. They're Raman anayses of bubbles in olivine-hosted melt inclusions from Etna... or maybe they're from somewhere else... who can say?
